### Project 1 - Synthetic Image Generator

       Details and Features - 
            The project focuses on generating synthetically generated images with any type of text provided
            by the user. It has been implemented in Python and deals with Image processing using Pillow and
            OpenCV packages.
            
            It first changes the text so that it can be in a specific format (From Right to Left) in the 
            document. Also the text is divided into paragraphs that appear from right to left and divided
            into random number of rows.
            
            All of text is then imposed on a plain background and this leads to creation of Synthetic Images.
            The client/user can decide how many Synthetic need to be generated and accordingly different
            images are generated (Being randomly chosen parameters, hence images are not same)
